***Java Banking System***

A console-based banking system built in Java using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

-Create bank accounts with CPF validation
-Login system
-Deposit and withdraw money
-Transfer between accounts
-Transaction history (audit log)

***Architecture***

The system follows a clean layered architecture:
---------------------------
ConsoleUI  → User Interface  
Bank       → Business rules  
Account    → Domain model  
User       → Identity model  
Transaction → Financial log  
---------------------------
Each layer has a single responsibility, similar to real backend systems.
